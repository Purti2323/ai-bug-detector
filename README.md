Simple rule-based code error detection tool using Python

# AI-Enhanced Bug Detection System (Rule-Based Version)

This project is a simple Python-based tool that detects common coding issues in beginner-level programs.  
The goal is to assist new programmers by identifying basic syntactical and structural errors.

##  Features
- Detects **missing semicolons** in C/C++ code
- Flags **unmatched parentheses**
- Identifies **inconsistent indentation** (Python formatting)
- Warns about **Python2 print statements** that are incompatible with Python3

##  How It Works
The tool uses **rule-based pattern checks**, making it lightweight and easy to understand.  
It does not require machine learning or external libraries.

##  Run the Program
Paste your code when prompted, and it will analyze it.

##  Status
**Work in Progress**  
Future updates will include:
- Detection of missing brackets `{ }`
- Detection of common logical mistakes
